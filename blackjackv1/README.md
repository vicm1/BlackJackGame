## Getting Started
To run the project on Android Studio without any out of bounds errors on the screen. Make sure the emulator screen size is at least 5.5 inches. But for the best user experience, 6 inches will be the perfect fit.
We recommend using the Pixel 5 emulator for the perfect screen.

example:
flutter pub add just_audio
flutter pub add flutter_switch
```
